<p>NHS Tayside Charitable Foundation is delighted to announce a funding award of £25,000 to NE Wellbeing Solutions to significantly expand their impactful project within the Wellbeing Woods. This vital funding will enable more young people in the Angus region to experience the numerous benefits of engaging with nature, a key priority for the Charitable Foundation.</p>
<p>The funding boost will allow NE Wellbeing Solutions to extend the reach and capacity of their existing Wellbeing Woods initiative, providing increased opportunities for young individuals to connect with the natural environment. These experiences are crucial for promoting mental and physical wellbeing, fostering resilience, and providing valuable learning opportunities outside of traditional settings.</p>
<p>The announcement was celebrated with a photo opportunity featuring Gail Penman from NE Wellbeing Solutions, Mairi Gougeon MSP, Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs, Land Reform and Islands, and Sam Riddell, Trustee of NHS Tayside Charitable Foundation.</p>
<p>Sam Riddell, Trustee at NHS Tayside Charitable Foundation, commented: “It’s great to see this project growing to support even more young people in Angus to access nature. NHS Tayside Charitable Foundation’s vision is to help the people of Tayside live better and longer lives, and this project directly supports that goal by investing in the wellbeing of our young people.”</p>
<p>Gail Penman from NE Wellbeing Solutions said, “We are so pleased to have continued support of NHS Tayside Charitable foundation funding which will allow us to continue to develop our wellbeing woodland site and expand the offer of health and wellbeing activity for the people of Angus. We are committed to delivering an onsite experience to remember for children, adults and families.” </p>
<p>This funding award underscores NHS Tayside Charitable Foundation’s commitment to supporting initiatives that improve health services and contribute to the overall wellbeing of the local community. By partnering with organisations like NE Wellbeing Solutions, the Foundation aims to make a tangible difference in the lives of people across Tayside.</p>

<p>Tayside Healthcare Arts Trust (THAT) worked to deliver creative engagement programmes across Tayside to people living with mixed long-term conditions, carers, staff, and family. The programmes were a response to COVID-19 restrictions and combined outdoor and online group activities. The emphasis was on supporting and encouraging a gradual return to normality.  All programmes required to respond to health and wellbeing regulations, venue restrictions, and safe distancing guidelines.</p>
<p>Within Angus: THAT has continued to develop its partnership relationship with Hospitalfield House Arbroath.</p>
<p>A new group of individuals with a variety of ages and long-term health conditions, some of whom had never been to Hospitalfield, engaged in the programme, which included journal taking, discussion, research, art and printing.</p>
<p>This new group was recruited through the AAVO and NHST specialist link contacts. During the two years of COVID restrictions regulating group activity, Individuals met either online or in person. Many of the group members were socially isolated over the two-year period of the pandemic. </p>
<p>Within Dundee:  THAT Mind Matters Workshops delivered in partnership with Community Health Specialist Nurse/ Nurse Team Leader Health Inequalities Service Dundee Health and Social Care Partnership.</p>
<p>THAT provided visual arts as a contributing component part of the Mind Matters, social isolation project 2021-22.  The project highlighted assistance to individual mental health as a valuable and positive stepping stone to people managing their own well-being and care within their community.</p>
<p>THAT worked with 33 participants in Dundee and Angus.</p>
<p>The delivery of this project in 2021-22 programmes showed that, despite the ongoing restrictions of the Coronavirus pandemic, THAT managed to redevelop its high-quality service. Although changes in models and forging new partnerships took time due to covid restrictions, THAT clearly showed that they were able to respond and be an innovative and positive source of support for people in the LTC community during the Coronavirus pandemic.</p>

Witnessing first-hand the joy, connection, and sense of community fostered through these sessions was truly inspiring. Initiatives like this not only support physical well-being but also provide a vital space for social interaction, reducing isolation for both participants and their loved ones. The NHS Tayside Charitable Foundation is proud to support this invaluable program, ensuring that those living with Parkinson’s and their families continue to benefit from these uplifting sessions.&#8221;</em></span></p><p><span data-ogsc="rgb(0, 36, 81)">Abi Borthwick, Development Officer, Perth Theatre and Concert Hall, stated that the donation from NHS Tayside Charitable Foundation has helped ensure that regular classes at Perth Concert Hall can continue and have been invaluable for all the participants.

									<p><strong>Innovative outdoor space set to enhance patient rehabilitation</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>A NEWLY renovated sensory garden at Tay Ward, Perth Royal Infirmary (PRI) has opened its doors, set to enhance patient rehabilitation and wellbeing.</p>
<p>The project, funded by NHS Tayside Charitable Foundation and supported by national walking charity Paths for All, has transformed a previously unused outdoor space into a purposefully designed area for patients, staff, and visitors.</p>
<p>The garden, which opened on October 2nd to coincide with the International Day of Older Persons, aims to improve patient rehabilitation by providing a safe outdoor environment for physical activity, social interaction and connection to nature.</p>
<p>Kayleigh Lytham, Active Health and Care Manager at Paths for All, said: “By providing a safe, accessible outdoor space, we&#8217;re not just improving the physical environment – it’s enhancing the overall rehabilitation experience.</p>
<p>“This garden offers patients the opportunity to engage in crucial walking, strength, and balance activities in a quiet, natural setting, which can significantly boost their recovery and overall wellbeing.</p>
<p><strong>“It&#8217;s a prime example of how thoughtful design can create a culture of physical activity within a healthcare setting, benefiting both patients and staff.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>The new garden features improved walkways for patients to practice mobility and balance, new seating, sensory planting, nature interpretation board and garden tools. Dedicated areas have been created with the addition of Strength and Balance movement posts.</p>
<p>Charity Chief Officer of NHS Tayside Charitable Foundation, Shelley McCarthy said: “This type of project really helps to enhance the patient experience and is something that the Foundation are really passionate about in helping to achieve our vision to help the people of Tayside live better and longer lives.”</p>
<p>Walking combined with strength and balance encourages mobility, stability and confidence in movement. Regularly and consistently doing these movements can help an individual build muscle strength, improve overall balance and reduces the risk of falls, or repeat falls, particularly when accessing the outdoors.</p>
<p>Lisa McFarlane, team lead for Physiotherapy at Tay Ward, said: “The new garden will motivate our patients, and will help make them feel revived and refreshed.  Some of our patients have already engaged not only with the garden but are also recognising the outdoor exercises from the work they have been doing in the gym or at home. Having the exercise equipment outside benefits both the physical and mental wellbeing of patients.”</p>
<p>The outdoor space was designed to be as attractive as possible to provide a stress-free and relaxing environment and to encourage patients to spend time outside whilst benefiting from fresh air and daylight as part of their rehabilitation.</p>
<p>The project particularly benefits elderly and frail patients in long-term care at PRI, many of whom are recovering from falls or managing conditions such as dementia or Parkinson&#8217;s.</p>
<p>One patient said, “It’s been so lovely to be able to get out of the ward, especially as the weather was so nice.”</p>
<p>Healthcare staff have been provided with training and resources to support them to deliver walking with strength and balance activities, by building into daily practice and care.</p>
<p>Anne Davidson, senior nurse for medicine for the elderly said: “I’m thrilled to have finally seen this project come to fruition and am already seeing the joy of patients being able to use this outside space. I would like to thank everyone who has made this possible.”</p>
<p>This initiative reflects a broader commitment to creating a culture of physical activity within healthcare settings, benefiting both patients and staff. By providing opportunities for outdoor rehabilitation, the garden is expected to contribute to improved patient outcomes.</p>
<p>The completion of this project marks a significant step in enhancing patient care on Tay Ward at Perth Royal Infirmary, offering a healing environment that supports physical, mental, and social wellbeing.</p>
