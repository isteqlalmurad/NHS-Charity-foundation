The sessions are designed to promote physical activity, mental well-being, and social inclusion for those living with Parkinson&#8217;s\u00a0Disease and their loved ones.<\/span><\/p><p><span data-ogsc=\"rgb(0, 36, 81)\">Brian Jones, NHS Tayside Charitable Foundation Trustee, commented: <em>&#8220;The Dance for Parkinson\u2019s program at Perth Concert Hall is a shining example of how arts and health can come together to make a meaningful difference in people\u2019s lives. Witnessing first-hand the joy, connection, and sense of community fostered through these sessions was truly inspiring. Initiatives like this not only support physical well-being but also provide a vital space for social interaction, reducing isolation for both participants and their loved ones. The NHS Tayside Charitable Foundation is proud to support this invaluable program, ensuring that those living with Parkinson\u2019s and their families continue to benefit from these uplifting sessions.&#8221;<\/em><\/span><\/p><p><span data-ogsc=\"rgb(0, 36, 81)\">Abi Borthwick, Development Officer, Perth Theatre and Concert Hall, stated that the donation from NHS Tayside Charitable Foundation has helped ensure that\u00a0regular classes at Perth Concert Hall can continue and have been invaluable for all the participants. Here is a comment we received on the day of the visit from the wife of one of the participants. She stated that she wanted to share her personal thanks to the funders.<\/span><\/p><p><span data-ogsc=\"rgb(0, 36, 81)\">\u201cMy husband has Dementia as well as Parkinson\u2019s Disease &amp; it is a valuable time in the week, I can share with others because being a wife, Dementia is quite isolating.<\/span><\/p><p><span data-ogsc=\"rgb(0, 36, 81)\">This morning, before we reached the class, I must have been asked seven or eight times where we were going. It\u2019s such a joy to get to the class and forget the earlier questions. Some of the others stopped on their way into the class and wheeled Ian in in his wheelchair.\u00a0I could take a deep breath, drive off to park the car &amp; have a \u201cwalk\u201d back to the Concert Hall knowing Ian was in safe hands with our 3 brilliant volunteers &amp; Julie, Niamh &amp; Carmen, cracking jokes with someone else rather than looking at my \u201cface\u201d.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><em><span data-ogsc=\"rgb(0, 36, 81)\">Colleen Carlton, NHS Tayside Charitable Foundation Trustee, added, &#8220;It was a pleasure to be invited to join a Dance for Parkinson&#8217;s session at Perth Concert Hall.
