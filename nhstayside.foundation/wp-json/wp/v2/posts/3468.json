This financial boost has allowed the organisation to increase its meal distribution efforts, now providing over 1,000 meals per week to individuals and families facing food insecurity. This expansion not only addresses immediate hunger but also strengthens the organisation&#8217;s mission to foster resilience and improve the overall well-being of those it serves. The funding underscores the importance of community support and collaboration in combating food poverty which compliments the Foundation\u2019s vision to help the people of Tayside live better and longer lives.\u201d<\/p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span data-ogsc=\"black\">As well as Dundee, Signpost International supports people across the world to be the drivers of their own change, empowering them to tackle poverty and injustice and to build communities where people can thrive and <\/span><span data-ogsc=\"black\">flourish.\u00a0 Focusing on four key themes (Food security; Sustainable livelihoods; Water, sanitation, &amp; hygiene; and Global citizenship), the charity supports around 30-35K people through global partnerships each year.\u00a0 <\/span><\/p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span data-ogsc=\"black\">For more information, visit <\/span><span data-ogsc=\"black\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theroundhouse.scot\/\" data-ogsc=\"\" data-outlook-id=\"d576c8c3-0576-4f1d-a240-5156f56b00e5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https:\/\/theroundhouse.scot\/<\/a><\/span><\/p><\/div><p data-ogsb=\"white\">Author: Claire Grainger, Grainger PR<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A Dundee project dedicated to improving diet and nutrition while reducing food waste is set to expand, thanks to a generous grant from NHS Tayside Charitable Foundation.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4,"featured_media":3469,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[12,6],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-3468","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-case-study","category-projects"],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3468","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/4"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3468"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3468\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":3628,"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3468\/revisions\/3628"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/3469"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3468"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3468"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3468"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
