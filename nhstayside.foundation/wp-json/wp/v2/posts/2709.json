This lack of connection can have negative impacts on their physical and mental health. The Playful Green Planet program seeks to address this issue by creating vibrant, nature-based play spaces in urban and economically disadvantaged areas.<\/p><p><strong>How the Program Works<\/strong><\/p><p>The program involves identifying suitable areas of land and transforming them into ecologically thriving outdoor playrooms and classrooms. These spaces will be designed to foster children&#8217;s creativity, social activism, and connection to nature.<\/p><p><strong>NHS Tayside Charitable Foundation&#8217;s Role<\/strong><\/p><p>The NHS Tayside Charitable Foundation is proud to contribute to this important initiative. Our funding will help to support the development and implementation of the Playful Green Planet program, ensuring that children in our community have access to these valuable outdoor learning experiences.<\/p><p><strong>Benefits for Children<\/strong><\/p><p>The Playful Green Planet program offers numerous benefits for children, including:<\/p><ul><li>Improved physical health<\/li><li>Enhanced mental well-being<\/li><li>Increased creativity and problem-solving skills<\/li><li>Stronger social connections<\/li><li>Greater appreciation for the natural environment<br \/><br \/><\/li><\/ul><p>The NHS Tayside Charitable Foundation is committed to supporting initiatives that promote the health and well-being of our community. We believe that the Playful Green Planet program is a valuable investment in the future of our children. By providing them with opportunities to connect with nature and develop essential life skills, we are helping to create a healthier and more sustainable society.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The NHS Tayside Charitable Foundation is proud to support the groundbreaking Playful Green Planet program, an initiative that aims to transform how children connect with nature and community through outdoor creative play.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4,"featured_media":2710,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[12],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-2709","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-case-study"],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2709","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/4"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2709"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2709\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2710"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2709"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2709"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2709"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
