Underpinning this is a drive to challenge stigma, inequality, discrimination and marginalisation coupled with a belief that recovery is possible for everyone.<\/p><p>Initiated in 2015, the Safe Zone project supported emergency services with the effects of certain behaviours linked to Dundee\u2019s night-time economy.<\/p><p>Assisting those adversely affected by alcohol and other substances, Safe Zone originally operated on Friday and Saturday nights within a city centre location.\u00a0\u00a0 At that time, a minibus supported a larger bus, which remained static throughout the shift. The project was linked via radio to various pubs and clubs around the city centre, allowing clients to be transported by minibus to the main bus for additional help.\u00a0 Regular \u2018sweeps\u2019 of the city centre also enabled communication with Tayside Police if \u2018hot spots\u2019 were identified. The main aim was to ensure the safety and wellbeing of those enjoying the night-time economy and to offer a safe space for vulnerable individuals during the evening and nighttime.<\/p>                        <\/div>\n\n                    <\/div>\n\n                <\/div><!-- .elementskit-card END -->\n\n                \n                <div class=\"elementskit-card \">\n                    <div class=\"elementskit-card-header\" id=\"primaryHeading-1-0a087ab\">\n                        <a href=\"#collapse-1c422026805224677739\" class=\"ekit-accordion--toggler elementskit-btn-link collapsed\" data-ekit-toggle=\"collapse\" data-target=\"#Collapse-1c422026805224677739\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"Collapse-1c422026805224677739\">\n                            \n                            <span class=\"ekit-accordion-title\">The Challenge<\/span>\n\n                            \n                                <div class=\"ekit_accordion_icon_group\">\n                                    <div class=\"ekit_accordion_normal_icon\">\n                                        <!-- Normal Icon -->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"icon icon-down-arrow1\"><\/i>                                    <\/div>\n\n                                    <div class=\"ekit_accordion_active_icon\">\n                                        <!-- Active Icon -->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"icon icon-up-arrow\"><\/i>                                    <\/div>\n                                <\/div>\n\n                            \n                                                    <\/a>\n                    <\/div>\n\n                    <div id=\"Collapse-1c422026805224677739\" class=\" collapse\" aria-labelledby=\"primaryHeading-1-0a087ab\" data-parent=\"#accordion-6805224677739\">\n\n                        <div class=\"elementskit-card-body ekit-accordion--content\">\n                            <p>When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, the city centre\u2019s pubs and nightclubs closed due to lockdown. However, the lockdown also closed many other community resources, leaving some of the city\u2019s most vulnerable individuals without the support they needed.<\/p><p>In response, Safe Zone worked with several statutory and third sector social care providers to react to this need, providing a multi-agency mobile support hub targeting the city's key areas.<\/p><p>Following this initial deployment, a clear ongoing need was identified, and the bus is now based at Court Street in Stobswell from 6-8.30pm on Friday evenings and outside Farmfoods in Lochee on Saturday evenings, with both locations well-attended by clients with a range of support needs.<\/p><p>Teodor Omelasz, TCA Innovation and Development Manager at Tayside Council on Alcohol said, \u201cAs more people felt the impact of food and fuel poverty and the knock-on effect of isolation during Covid, the number of people coming to the bus has increased. Most come for a hot drink, food and takeaway food parcel. We have also been able to source sanitary products and some clothing items.<\/p><p>\u201cAs well as the practical support on the night, we regularly signpost clients to other services or refer them to Safe Zone\u2019s Recovery Worker, who will contact and arrange to meet the client and help with their individual needs. This has been very successful as everyone\u2019s needs vary and this \u2018one-stop\u2019 service has shortened the time the client may otherwise take to access that support.<\/p><p>\u201cOf course, as more people rely on the bus, especially for a small food parcel, the demand for funding has grown.\u00a0 Most of our food was sourced from FareShare. However, they are also experiencing a reduction in supplies and, therefore, Safe Zone has had to purchase increased stocks to meet the current demand.\u201d<\/p>                        <\/div>\n\n                    <\/div>\n\n                <\/div><!-- .elementskit-card END -->\n\n                \n                <div class=\"elementskit-card \">\n                    <div class=\"elementskit-card-header\" id=\"primaryHeading-2-0a087ab\">\n                        <a href=\"#collapse-65636af6805224677739\" class=\"ekit-accordion--toggler elementskit-btn-link collapsed\" data-ekit-toggle=\"collapse\" data-target=\"#Collapse-65636af6805224677739\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"Collapse-65636af6805224677739\">\n                            \n                            <span class=\"ekit-accordion-title\">The Response<\/span>\n\n                            \n                                <div class=\"ekit_accordion_icon_group\">\n                                    <div class=\"ekit_accordion_normal_icon\">\n                                        <!-- Normal Icon -->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"icon icon-down-arrow1\"><\/i>                                    <\/div>\n\n                                    <div class=\"ekit_accordion_active_icon\">\n                                        <!-- Active Icon -->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"icon icon-up-arrow\"><\/i>                                    <\/div>\n                                <\/div>\n\n                            \n                                                    <\/a>\n                    <\/div>\n\n                    <div id=\"Collapse-65636af6805224677739\" class=\" collapse\" aria-labelledby=\"primaryHeading-2-0a087ab\" data-parent=\"#accordion-6805224677739\">\n\n                        <div class=\"elementskit-card-body ekit-accordion--content\">\n                            <p>As is often the case, particularly across the third sector, Safe Zone has been funded by a series of fixed term grants. The changes to everyday life brought about by the response to the pandemic, which remained in place longer than anyone initially anticipated, negated the need for a return to the night-time provision. However, the need for an out-of-hours outreach service, connecting with those most marginalised due to challenges around substance use, mental health and poverty, was starkly apparent.<\/p><p>The team recognised the need to do more than offer crisis support. They approached the NHS Tayside Charitable Foundation to expand the service by offering a bridge into key health, social care, housing and welfare services via a community-based peer mentor post. TCA worked with the NHS Charitable Foundation and the Dundee Alcohol and Drug Partnership to form a partnership funding arrangement. This supported a model which retained the volunteer-based mobile outreach provision and enabled scope for follow-up mentoring designed to support engagement with the helping services needed to break the cycle of repeated crises.<\/p><p>Carole Bailey, the Safe Zone Coordinator, recently received a donation of \u00a320 from a previous service user.<\/p><p>She said, \u201cHe wanted to make this donation to say thanks for help received from staff on the bus and the support of the Recovery Worker.

Some are unaware that help is out there and others struggle to access them due to their chaotic lifestyles. \u00a0Without the support of the team on the bus, many of our service users would have very little contact with the outside world.

works alongside people, families and communities to mitigate the impact of substance use, gambling, offending and other risky or harmful behaviours. Underpinning this is a drive to challenge stigma, inequality, discrimination and marginalisation coupled with a belief that recovery is possible for everyone.<\/p>\n<p>Initiated in 2015, the Safe Zone project supported emergency services with the effects of certain behaviours linked to Dundee\u2019s night-time economy.<\/p>\n<p>Assisting those adversely affected by alcohol and other substances, Safe Zone originally operated on Friday and Saturday nights within a city centre location.   At that time, a minibus supported a larger bus, which remained static throughout the shift. The project was linked via radio to various pubs and clubs around the city centre, allowing clients to be transported by minibus to the main bus for additional help.  Regular \u2018sweeps\u2019 of the city centre also enabled communication with Tayside Police if \u2018hot spots\u2019 were identified. The main aim was to ensure the safety and wellbeing of those enjoying the night-time economy and to offer a safe space for vulnerable individuals during the evening and nighttime.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":775,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[12],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-562","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-case-study"],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/562","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=562"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/562\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/775"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=562"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=562"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=562"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
