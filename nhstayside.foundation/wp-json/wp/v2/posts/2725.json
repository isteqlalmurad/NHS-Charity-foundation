Dedicated areas have been created with the addition of Strength and Balance movement posts.<\/p>\n<p>Charity Chief Officer of NHS Tayside Charitable Foundation, Shelley McCarthy said: \u201cThis type of project really helps to enhance the patient experience and is something that the Foundation are really passionate about in helping to achieve our vision to help the people of Tayside live better and longer lives.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Walking combined with strength and balance encourages mobility, stability and confidence in movement. Regularly and consistently doing these movements can help an individual build muscle strength, improve overall balance and reduces the risk of falls, or repeat falls, particularly when accessing the outdoors.<\/p>\n<p>Lisa McFarlane, team lead for Physiotherapy at Tay Ward, said: \u201cThe new garden will motivate our patients, and will help make them feel revived and refreshed.\u00a0 Some of our patients have already engaged not only with the garden but are also recognising the outdoor exercises from the work they have been doing in the gym or at home. Having the exercise equipment outside benefits both the physical and mental wellbeing of patients.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The outdoor space was designed to be as attractive as possible to provide a stress-free and relaxing environment and to encourage patients to spend time outside whilst benefiting from fresh air and daylight as part of their rehabilitation.<\/p>\n<p>The project particularly benefits elderly and frail patients in long-term care at PRI, many of whom are recovering from falls or managing conditions such as dementia or Parkinson&#8217;s.<\/p>\n<p>One patient said, \u201cIt\u2019s been so lovely to be able to get out of the ward, especially as the weather was so nice.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Healthcare staff have been provided with training and resources to support them to deliver walking with strength and balance activities, by building into daily practice and care.<\/p>\n<p>Anne Davidson, senior nurse for medicine for the elderly said: \u201cI\u2019m thrilled to have finally seen this project come to fruition and am already seeing the joy of patients being able to use this outside space. I would like to thank everyone who has made this possible.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This initiative reflects a broader commitment to creating a culture of physical activity within healthcare settings, benefiting both patients and staff. By providing opportunities for outdoor rehabilitation, the garden is expected to contribute to improved patient outcomes.<\/p>\n<p>The completion of this project marks a significant step in enhancing patient care on Tay Ward at Perth Royal Infirmary, offering a healing environment that supports physical, mental, and social wellbeing.<\/p>\n<p>For more information about Strength and Balance in healthcare setting, please visit: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pathsforall.org.uk\/walking-for-health\/strength-and-balance\/healthcare-settings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Strength and Balance in Healthcare Settings | Paths for All<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Published on behalf of Paths for All by Holyrood PR.<\/strong><\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A NEWLY renovated sensory garden at Tay Ward, Perth Royal Infirmary (PRI) has opened its doors, set to enhance patient rehabilitation and wellbeing. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4,"featured_media":2726,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[12,6],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-2725","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-case-study","category-projects"],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2725","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/4"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2725"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2725\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2726"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2725"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2725"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2725"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
