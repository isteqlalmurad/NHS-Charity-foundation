The partnership was aided by a statement of understanding.<\/p><p>SSD wants to create compassionate communities through conversations about death, dying, loss and care. Death has been described by Julia Samuel, the bestselling author of \u2018Grief Works\u2019, as the last great taboo. By opening up safe spaces for conversations around death, we hope to help enable people to navigate through grief for those who have lost loved ones and help those nearing the end of life to adequately plan ahead.<\/p>                        <\/div>\n\n                    <\/div>\n\n                <\/div><!-- .elementskit-card END -->\n\n                \n                <div class=\"elementskit-card \">\n                    <div class=\"elementskit-card-header\" id=\"primaryHeading-1-0a087ab\">\n                        <a href=\"#collapse-1c42202680521fb77605\" class=\"ekit-accordion--toggler elementskit-btn-link collapsed\" data-ekit-toggle=\"collapse\" data-target=\"#Collapse-1c42202680521fb77605\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"Collapse-1c42202680521fb77605\">\n                            \n                            <span class=\"ekit-accordion-title\">\u2022  The Objectives<\/span>\n\n                            \n                                <div class=\"ekit_accordion_icon_group\">\n                                    <div class=\"ekit_accordion_normal_icon\">\n                                        <!-- Normal Icon -->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"icon icon-down-arrow1\"><\/i>                                    <\/div>\n\n                                    <div class=\"ekit_accordion_active_icon\">\n                                        <!-- Active Icon -->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"icon icon-up-arrow\"><\/i>                                    <\/div>\n                                <\/div>\n\n                            \n                                                    <\/a>\n                    <\/div>\n\n                    <div id=\"Collapse-1c42202680521fb77605\" class=\" collapse\" aria-labelledby=\"primaryHeading-1-0a087ab\" data-parent=\"#accordion-680521fb77605\">\n\n                        <div class=\"elementskit-card-body ekit-accordion--content\">\n                            <p>There were several objectives and aims underpinning SSD, which were governed by the Funeral Link trustees but run operationally in partnership with the SSD steering group.

This person would develop and run around 10 community workshops on what conversations to have when death occurs and how to support people who are grieving.<\/p><p>\u2022 To develop and trial an additional workshop about planning ahead towards the end of life, which engages the development of wills and power of attorney, as well as helping people plan funerals and the potential of living eulogies. \u2022 To work in partnership with Funeral Link support workers to ensure a regular presence at bereavement cafes and community projects across Dundee, enhancing visibility and upscaling accessibility to the public.<\/p><p>\u2022 To embed and create a process of consistent monitoring and evaluation throughout the tenure of the project to assess its suitability or any anticipated need for change. All evaluation would endeavor to engage with people who used the workshops or training to explore their experiences.<\/p><p>\u2022 To explore new and innovative approaches, as part of the innovation strand funded by NHS Tayside Charitable Foundation (NHSTCF), to approach issues of death, dying, loss and care, which could be developed into the ongoing work of SSD.<\/p>                        <\/div>\n\n                    <\/div>\n\n                <\/div><!-- .elementskit-card END -->\n\n                \n                <div class=\"elementskit-card \">\n                    <div class=\"elementskit-card-header\" id=\"primaryHeading-2-0a087ab\">\n                        <a href=\"#collapse-65636af680521fb77605\" class=\"ekit-accordion--toggler elementskit-btn-link collapsed\" data-ekit-toggle=\"collapse\" data-target=\"#Collapse-65636af680521fb77605\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"Collapse-65636af680521fb77605\">\n                            \n                            <span class=\"ekit-accordion-title\">\u2022  The Activities<\/span>\n\n                            \n                                <div class=\"ekit_accordion_icon_group\">\n                                    <div class=\"ekit_accordion_normal_icon\">\n                                        <!-- Normal Icon -->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"icon icon-down-arrow1\"><\/i>                                    <\/div>\n\n                                    <div class=\"ekit_accordion_active_icon\">\n                                        <!-- Active Icon -->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"icon icon-up-arrow\"><\/i>                                    <\/div>\n                                <\/div>\n\n                            \n                                                    <\/a>\n                    <\/div>\n\n                    <div id=\"Collapse-65636af680521fb77605\" class=\" collapse\" aria-labelledby=\"primaryHeading-2-0a087ab\" data-parent=\"#accordion-680521fb77605\">\n\n                        <div class=\"elementskit-card-body ekit-accordion--content\">\n                            <p>There were several objectives and aims underpinning SSD, which were governed by the Funeral Link trustees but run operationally in partnership with the steering group. In line with those articulated above, here we delve into what our evaluation told us about our performance into each area.<\/p><p>\u2022 We recruited a part-time SSD worker \u2013 Vanessa Kelly \u2013 on a fixed-term contract until January 2024. By then, she had created and delivered 23 workshops entitled \u2018What to Say?\u2019 and \u2018How Best to Support\u2019 in community centres across Dundee, including in Fintry, Hilltown and Mid-Craigie.<\/p><p>\u2022 We delivered a reasonably well-attended \u2018Planning Ahead\u2019 event, which was delivered at an in person meeting co-facilitated with a local solicitor, who talked to people about Power of Attorney and Wills. Our evaluation showed there is a strong appetite for more of this kind of planning work.<\/p><p>\u2022 We, in tandem with a Funeral Link employee, ensured weekly attendance through out 2023 and 2024 at the \u2018Life After Loss\u2019 caf\u00e9, into which we introduced suitable grieving clients, as well as meeting others in community cafes to ensure visibility, where we regularly interacted with people.<\/p><p>\u2022 We introduced evaluation early on, which was completed by every attendee at public workshops. Feedback was extremely positive and proved a useful way to identify scope for innovation. Vanessa followed up every person who engaged to assess the viability of further development.<\/p><p>\u2022 We learned, as a result of evaluation, that there was an appetite for more support at the end of life. We identified a course called EASE. Vanessa recruited people and ran her first course in September 2023. She had run six online events by January 2024 and feedback was positive.<\/p>                        <\/div>\n\n                    <\/div>\n\n                <\/div><!-- .elementskit-card END -->\n\n                \n                <div class=\"elementskit-card \">\n                    <div class=\"elementskit-card-header\" id=\"primaryHeading-3-0a087ab\">\n                        <a href=\"#collapse-c1f18bd680521fb77605\" class=\"ekit-accordion--toggler elementskit-btn-link collapsed\" data-ekit-toggle=\"collapse\" data-target=\"#Collapse-c1f18bd680521fb77605\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"Collapse-c1f18bd680521fb77605\">\n                            \n                            <span class=\"ekit-accordion-title\">\u2022  The Impact<\/span>\n\n                            \n                                <div class=\"ekit_accordion_icon_group\">\n                                    <div class=\"ekit_accordion_normal_icon\">\n                                        <!-- Normal Icon -->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"icon icon-down-arrow1\"><\/i>                                    <\/div>\n\n                                    <div class=\"ekit_accordion_active_icon\">\n                                        <!-- Active Icon -->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"icon icon-up-arrow\"><\/i>                                    <\/div>\n                                <\/div>\n\n                            \n                                                    <\/a>\n                    <\/div>\n\n                    <div id=\"Collapse-c1f18bd680521fb77605\" class=\" collapse\" aria-labelledby=\"primaryHeading-3-0a087ab\" data-parent=\"#accordion-680521fb77605\">\n\n                        <div class=\"elementskit-card-body ekit-accordion--content\">\n                            <p>We had identified aspired outcomes for SSD, working these back into objectives, which were outlined above and reflected upon in the following section. Here, we take some time to analyse the outcomes of these objectives, with direct reference to our evaluation.<\/p><p>\u2022 We could find no equivalent service anywhere in Scotland providing what Funeral Link does in terms of funeral planning after a loss nor what SSD do in terms of supporting people with planning ahead prior to death. In this regard, we believe both services to be both unique and innovative.<\/p><p>\u2022 We found outcomes in direct relation to planning ahead to be highly effective in terms of reducing anxiety, stress and worry towards the end of life. Research was conducted by Sunlife during the tenure of this project which revealed only one in five talk to loved ones about end of life plans.<\/p><p>\u2022 We discovered that adding an online element to workshops in relation to EASE was a welcome innovation for attendees, which were run alongside the Scottish Partnership for Palliative Care and all of which were fully subscribed, highlighting the extent of interest.<\/p><p>\u2022 One outcome we have yet to turn into a reality and which we hope to in the second year of this project is developing a fully-fledged \u2018Planning Ahead\u2019 programme working with people in person around the development of a funeral plan as well as developing a living eulogy, if so desired.<\/p><p>\u2022 One outcome we have also yet to turn into a reality is to secure funding to open a community facility where we can deliver a number of these outcomes as well as delivering in house training and peer-to-peer support for bereaved individuals.<\/p>                        <\/div>\n\n                    <\/div>\n\n                <\/div><!-- .elementskit-card END -->\n\n                                        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-f2f223d e-flex e-con-boxed e-con e-parent\" data-id=\"f2f223d\" data-element_type=\"container\" data-settings=\"{&quot;background_background&quot;:&quot;classic&quot;}\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"e-con-inner\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-e4a89eb elementor-widget__width-auto elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"e4a89eb\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h6 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">The Next Steps<\/h6>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-583c2a9 e-con-full e-flex e-con e-child\" data-id=\"583c2a9\" data-element_type=\"container\" data-settings=\"{&quot;background_background&quot;:&quot;classic&quot;}\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-8b39066 elementor-widget__width-auto elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"8b39066\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">The final two outcomes of the previous section we would like to see through to completion.

A portion has been awarded by NHSTCF and we are seeking match-funding from another donor who has pledged an unconfirmed figure to help us open a facility in Dundee, with which to deliver activities as well as supporting core costs related to SSD.<\/h1>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-1c06419 elementor-widget__width-inherit elementor-align-justify elementor-widget elementor-widget-button\" data-id=\"1c06419\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"button.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-button-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"elementor-button elementor-button-link elementor-size-lg\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/SaySomethingDundee\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-button-content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-button-text\">For more information, visit Say Something Dundee<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Since opening in 2013, our ADHD support group service supports children, young people and families that are affected by ADHD.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4,"featured_media":2717,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[12],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-2716","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-case-study"],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2716","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/4"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2716"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2716\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2717"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2716"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2716"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/nhstayside.foundation\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2716"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
