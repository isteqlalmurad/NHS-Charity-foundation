As part of the assessment process we engage with key organisations like Health and Social Care Partnerships and Public Health to ensure there is no duplication of provision.<\/p><p>After this process your application is scored against our matrix which is shown in the Governance Plan on the website. If your application is under \u00a325,000 this is then taken to the Management Committee which is made up of the managers of the charity. This group meets monthly to ensure there is a good turnover of decisions. If your application is over \u00a325,000 it goes to our Charitable Funds Committee where you have the opportunity to present to the Trustees and they can ask some questions.<\/p><p>Throughout the process we may need to engage with you to get additional information, especially if you have applied for a large grant. This is standard practice for funders to ensure we have all of the required information to make an informed decision.<\/p>                        <\/div>\n\n                    <\/div>\n\n                <\/div><!-- .elementskit-card END -->\n\n                \n                <div class=\"elementskit-card \">\n                    <div class=\"elementskit-card-header\" id=\"primaryHeading-8-56bc512\">\n                        <a href=\"#collapse-f4ee977680520f679ce1\" class=\"ekit-accordion--toggler elementskit-btn-link collapsed\" data-ekit-toggle=\"collapse\" data-target=\"#Collapse-f4ee977680520f679ce1\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"Collapse-f4ee977680520f679ce1\">\n                            \n                            <span class=\"ekit-accordion-title\">I already have a grant from you, can I apply again?<\/span>\n\n                            \n                                <div class=\"ekit_accordion_icon_group\">\n                                    <div class=\"ekit_accordion_normal_icon\">\n                                        <!-- Normal Icon -->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"icon icon-down-arrow1\"><\/i>                                    <\/div>\n\n                                    <div class=\"ekit_accordion_active_icon\">\n                                        <!-- Active Icon -->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"icon icon-up-arrow\"><\/i>                                    <\/div>\n                                <\/div>\n\n                            \n                                                    <\/a>\n                    <\/div>\n\n                    <div id=\"Collapse-f4ee977680520f679ce1\" class=\" collapse\" aria-labelledby=\"primaryHeading-8-56bc512\" data-parent=\"#accordion-680520f679ce1\">\n\n                        <div class=\"elementskit-card-body ekit-accordion--content\">\n                            <p>If you already have an ongoing application with us we would encourage you to get in touch to discuss your funding requirements as we would need to ensure multiple applications could be managed effectively in terms of your organisational capacity.<\/p>                        <\/div>\n\n                    <\/div>\n\n                <\/div><!-- .elementskit-card END -->\n\n                \n                <div class=\"elementskit-card \">\n                    <div class=\"elementskit-card-header\" id=\"primaryHeading-9-56bc512\">\n                        <a href=\"#collapse-14eff02680520f679ce1\" class=\"ekit-accordion--toggler elementskit-btn-link collapsed\" data-ekit-toggle=\"collapse\" data-target=\"#Collapse-14eff02680520f679ce1\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"Collapse-14eff02680520f679ce1\">\n                            \n                            <span class=\"ekit-accordion-title\">I recently applied to you but was unsuccessful.

It is essentially the principles against which your organisation carries out its work and your process for decision-making. We expect your organisation to have a minimum of three unconnected Trustees or Directors and for you to be able to show that you hold regular meetings. If your charity employs staff who are also Trustees\/Directors, or there are any related\/connected persons within the organisation, we will ask you to provide details of the policies you have in place to mitigate any conflict of interest.<\/p><p>It is always helpful for you to explain any plans you may have in place to change your board structure under these circumstances. Please note that we will not consider funding the salaries of employees who also hold Trustee\/Director positions within the applicant organisation. Other indicators of good governance include openness and transparency with your internal policies, strong financial controls and fair decision-making processes. It also includes access to appropriate training and support for your staff and volunteers, and the effective management of relationships with partners and stakeholders. You may also want to highlight in your application any key organisation accreditations you have, and\/or recent reports from regulatory bodies such as the Care Inspectorate.<\/p>                        <\/div>\n\n                    <\/div>\n\n                <\/div><!-- .elementskit-card END -->\n\n                \n                <div class=\"elementskit-card \">\n                    <div class=\"elementskit-card-header\" id=\"primaryHeading-11-56bc512\">\n                        <a href=\"#collapse-47266b1680520f679ce1\" class=\"ekit-accordion--toggler elementskit-btn-link collapsed\" data-ekit-toggle=\"collapse\" data-target=\"#Collapse-47266b1680520f679ce1\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"Collapse-47266b1680520f679ce1\">\n                            \n                            <span class=\"ekit-accordion-title\">I\u2019m not sure how to complete the budget section of the application form \u2013 can I provide my own budget?<\/span>\n\n                            \n                                <div class=\"ekit_accordion_icon_group\">\n                                    <div class=\"ekit_accordion_normal_icon\">\n                                        <!-- Normal Icon -->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"icon icon-down-arrow1\"><\/i>                                    <\/div>\n\n                                    <div class=\"ekit_accordion_active_icon\">\n                                        <!-- Active Icon -->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"icon icon-up-arrow\"><\/i>                                    <\/div>\n                                <\/div>\n\n                            \n                                                    <\/a>\n                    <\/div>\n\n                    <div id=\"Collapse-47266b1680520f679ce1\" class=\" collapse\" aria-labelledby=\"primaryHeading-11-56bc512\" data-parent=\"#accordion-680520f679ce1\">\n\n                        <div class=\"elementskit-card-body ekit-accordion--content\">\n                            <p>Yes.
