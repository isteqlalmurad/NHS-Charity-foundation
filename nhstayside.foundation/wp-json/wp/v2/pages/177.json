go through all of the paperwork and make sure we have all of the required information outlined in the criteria. If you are a registered charity we will check the OSCR website (or Companies House if you are a social enterprise) to ensure all of your paperwork is up to date. As part of the assessment process we engage with key organisations like Health and Social Care Partnerships and Public Health to ensure there is no duplication of provision.<\/p><p>After this process your application is scored against our matrix which is shown in the Governance Plan on the website. If your application is under \u00a325,000 this is then taken to the Management Committee which is made up of the managers of the charity. This group meets monthly to ensure there is a good turnover of decisions. If your application is over \u00a325,000 it goes to our Charitable Funds Committee where you have the opportunity to present to the Trustees and they can ask some questions.<\/p><p>Throughout the process we may need to engage with you to get additional information, especially if you have applied for a large grant. This is standard practice for funders to ensure we have all of the required information to make an informed decision.<\/p>                        <\/div>\n\n                    <\/div>\n\n                <\/div><!-- .elementskit-card END -->\n\n                                        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-53a4268 e-con-full e-flex e-con e-child\" data-id=\"53a4268\" data-element_type=\"container\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-707fbff elementor-hidden-desktop elementor-widget-divider--view-line elementor-widget elementor-widget-divider\" data-id=\"707fbff\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"divider.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-divider\">\n\t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-divider-separator\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-2067ba0 elementor-widget__width-inherit elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"2067ba0\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Application Guidance <\/h2>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-d4bd7d0 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"d4bd7d0\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Thank you for your interest in NHS Tayside Charitable Foundation funding.
