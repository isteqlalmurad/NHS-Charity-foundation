<p>NHS Tayside Charitable Foundation is delighted to announce a funding award of £25,000 to NE Wellbeing Solutions to significantly expand their impactful project within the Wellbeing Woods. This vital funding will enable more young people in the Angus region to experience the numerous benefits of engaging with nature, a key priority for the Charitable Foundation.</p>
<p>The funding boost will allow NE Wellbeing Solutions to extend the reach and capacity of their existing Wellbeing Woods initiative, providing increased opportunities for young individuals to connect with the natural environment. These experiences are crucial for promoting mental and physical wellbeing, fostering resilience, and providing valuable learning opportunities outside of traditional settings.</p>
<p>The announcement was celebrated with a photo opportunity featuring Gail Penman from NE Wellbeing Solutions, Mairi Gougeon MSP, Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs, Land Reform and Islands, and Sam Riddell, Trustee of NHS Tayside Charitable Foundation.</p>
<p>Sam Riddell, Trustee at NHS Tayside Charitable Foundation, commented: “It’s great to see this project growing to support even more young people in Angus to access nature. NHS Tayside Charitable Foundation’s vision is to help the people of Tayside live better and longer lives, and this project directly supports that goal by investing in the wellbeing of our young people.”</p>
<p>Gail Penman from NE Wellbeing Solutions said, “We are so pleased to have continued support of NHS Tayside Charitable foundation funding which will allow us to continue to develop our wellbeing woodland site and expand the offer of health and wellbeing activity for the people of Angus. We are committed to delivering an onsite experience to remember for children, adults and families.” </p>
<p>This funding award underscores NHS Tayside Charitable Foundation’s commitment to supporting initiatives that improve health services and contribute to the overall wellbeing of the local community. By partnering with organisations like NE Wellbeing Solutions, the Foundation aims to make a tangible difference in the lives of people across Tayside.</p>

<p>Tayside Healthcare Arts Trust (THAT) worked to deliver creative engagement programmes across Tayside to people living with mixed long-term conditions, carers, staff, and family. The programmes were a response to COVID-19 restrictions and combined outdoor and online group activities. The emphasis was on supporting and encouraging a gradual return to normality.  All programmes required to respond to health and wellbeing regulations, venue restrictions, and safe distancing guidelines.</p>
<p>Within Angus: THAT has continued to develop its partnership relationship with Hospitalfield House Arbroath.</p>
<p>A new group of individuals with a variety of ages and long-term health conditions, some of whom had never been to Hospitalfield, engaged in the programme, which included journal taking, discussion, research, art and printing.</p>
<p>This new group was recruited through the AAVO and NHST specialist link contacts. During the two years of COVID restrictions regulating group activity, Individuals met either online or in person. Many of the group members were socially isolated over the two-year period of the pandemic. </p>
<p>Within Dundee:  THAT Mind Matters Workshops delivered in partnership with Community Health Specialist Nurse/ Nurse Team Leader Health Inequalities Service Dundee Health and Social Care Partnership.</p>
<p>THAT provided visual arts as a contributing component part of the Mind Matters, social isolation project 2021-22.  The project highlighted assistance to individual mental health as a valuable and positive stepping stone to people managing their own well-being and care within their community.</p>
<p>THAT worked with 33 participants in Dundee and Angus.</p>
<p>The delivery of this project in 2021-22 programmes showed that, despite the ongoing restrictions of the Coronavirus pandemic, THAT managed to redevelop its high-quality service. Although changes in models and forging new partnerships took time due to covid restrictions, THAT clearly showed that they were able to respond and be an innovative and positive source of support for people in the LTC community during the Coronavirus pandemic.</p>

The sessions are designed to promote physical activity, mental well-being, and social inclusion for those living with Parkinson&#8217;s Disease and their loved ones.</span></p><p><span data-ogsc="rgb(0, 36, 81)">Brian Jones, NHS Tayside Charitable Foundation Trustee, commented: <em>&#8220;The Dance for Parkinson’s program at Perth Concert Hall is a shining example of how arts and health can come together to make a meaningful difference in people’s lives. Witnessing first-hand the joy, connection, and sense of community fostered through these sessions was truly inspiring. Initiatives like this not only support physical well-being but also provide a vital space for social interaction, reducing isolation for both participants and their loved ones. The NHS Tayside Charitable Foundation is proud to support this invaluable program, ensuring that those living with Parkinson’s and their families continue to benefit from these uplifting sessions.&#8221;</em></span></p><p><span data-ogsc="rgb(0, 36, 81)">Abi Borthwick, Development Officer, Perth Theatre and Concert Hall, stated that the donation from NHS Tayside Charitable Foundation has helped ensure that regular classes at Perth Concert Hall can continue and have been invaluable for all the participants. Here is a comment we received on the day of the visit from the wife of one of the participants. She stated that she wanted to share her personal thanks to the funders.</span></p><p><span data-ogsc="rgb(0, 36, 81)">“My husband has Dementia as well as Parkinson’s Disease &amp; it is a valuable time in the week, I can share with others because being a wife, Dementia is quite isolating.</span></p><p><span data-ogsc="rgb(0, 36, 81)">This morning, before we reached the class, I must have been asked seven or eight times where we were going. It’s such a joy to get to the class and forget the earlier questions. Some of the others stopped on their way into the class and wheeled Ian in in his wheelchair. I could take a deep breath, drive off to park the car &amp; have a “walk” back to the Concert Hall knowing Ian was in safe hands with our 3 brilliant volunteers &amp; Julie, Niamh &amp; Carmen, cracking jokes with someone else rather than looking at my “face”.”</span></p><p><em><span data-ogsc="rgb(0, 36, 81)">Colleen Carlton, NHS Tayside Charitable Foundation Trustee, added, &#8220;It was a pleasure to be invited to join a Dance for Parkinson&#8217;s session at Perth Concert Hall. Not only did I see how physically beneficial these sessions are, but I was also </span></em><span data-ogsc="rgb(0, 36, 81)">moved to witness the close friendships that have been created and built up within this fantastic group.</span></p></div>								</div>

									<div data-ogsc="rgb(0, 36, 81)"><p style="font-weight: 400;" data-ogsb="white"><span data-ogsc="black">A Dundee project dedicated to improving diet and nutrition while reducing food waste is set to expand, thanks to a generous grant from NHS Tayside Charitable Foundation.</span></p><p style="font-weight: 400;" data-ogsb="white"><span data-ogsc="black">Signpost International, based at The Roundhouse in Dundee, collects surplus food from supermarkets, greengrocers, bakers, and allotments. The charity then transforms it into nutritious frozen meals, which are distributed to those in need through foodbanks and larders.</span></p><p style="font-weight: 400;" data-ogsb="white"><span data-ogsc="black">Through a range of activities, the charity also works with community members, meal recipients, school pupils and young people to build their confidence, skills and understanding of growing, preserving and cooking fresh and nutritious foods. </span></p><p style="font-weight: 400;" data-ogsb="white"><span data-ogsc="black">The £80,000 grant will help the charity&#8217;s chefs boost meal production from 300 to 1,000 per week.</span></p><p style="font-weight: 400;" data-ogsb="white"><span data-ogsc="black">Jamie Morrison, CEO of Signpost International, said, “It is well-documented that poor diet is one the biggest preventable risk factors to ill health</span><span data-ogsc="black">, so we are doing all we can to help people in Tayside improve their health outcomes, especially those who are experiencing food insecurity. Our vision is to see people in Dundee enjoy improved access to good, nutritious food, become passionate about healthy eating habits and with enhanced skills to live healthier lives for longer.”</span></p><p style="font-weight: 400;" data-ogsb="white"><span data-ogsc="black">By expanding the project within the next two years, the charity will also </span><span data-ogsc="black">reduce the amount of surplus food going to landfill by repurposing approximately 56 tonnes of food into 91,000 nutritious meals, alongside awareness campaigns and workshops aimed at reducing household-level food waste.    </span></p><p style="font-weight: 400;" data-ogsb="white"><span data-ogsc="black">If that same 56 tonnes of edible food was wasted, it would release 140 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO</span><span data-ogsc="black">₂</span><span data-ogsc="black">). Additionally, when food ends up in landfill, it produces methane, a greenhouse gas 25 times more potent than CO</span><span data-ogsc="black">₂</span><span data-ogsc="black"> &#8211; at a rate of 0.5 kg per kilogram of food waste.</span></p><p style="font-weight: 400;" data-ogsb="white">Shelley McCarthy, Charity Chief Officer of NHS Tayside Charitable Foundation, added, “Signpost International recently received an £80,000 funding award from NHS Tayside Charitable Foundation that has enhanced their capacity to support communities in need. This financial boost has allowed the organisation to increase its meal distribution efforts, now providing over 1,000 meals per week to individuals and families facing food insecurity. This expansion not only addresses immediate hunger but also strengthens the organisation&#8217;s mission to foster resilience and improve the overall well-being of those it serves. The funding underscores the importance of community support and collaboration in combating food poverty which compliments the Foundation’s vision to help the people of Tayside live better and longer lives.”</p><p style="font-weight: 400;" data-ogsb="white"><span data-ogsc="black">As well as Dundee, Signpost International supports people across the world to be the drivers of their own change, empowering them to tackle poverty and injustice and to build communities where people can thrive and </span><span data-ogsc="black">flourish.  Focusing on four key themes (Food security; Sustainable livelihoods; Water, sanitation, &amp; hygiene; and Global citizenship), the charity supports around 30-35K people through global partnerships each year.  </span></p><p style="font-weight: 400;" data-ogsb="white"><span data-ogsc="black">For more information, visit </span><span data-ogsc="black"><a href="https://theroundhouse.scot/" data-ogsc="" data-outlook-id="d576c8c3-0576-4f1d-a240-5156f56b00e5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://theroundhouse.scot/</a></span></p></div><p data-ogsb="white">Author: Claire Grainger, Grainger PR</p>								</div>
